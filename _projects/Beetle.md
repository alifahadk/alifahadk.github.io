A fully sustainable agri-tech platform designed to bring Pakistanâ€™s farmers online, tailored to the local agricultural context. The platform comprises three interconnected components:

- **Crop Advisory via Machine Learning:**  
  - Provides disease detection and actionable recommendations for major crops in Pakistan.  
  - **My contribution:** Trained state-of-the-art CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models on local crop datasets using transfer learning and data augmentation.

- **Discussion Forum:**  
  - A dedicated forum for farmers to discuss agricultural issues and share solutions.  
  - **My contribution:** Designed and implemented a microservices-based backend using Django and MongoDB, supporting storage and retrieval of text, audio, and image media for both web and mobile applications.

- **Specialized B2C E-Commerce Platform:**  
  - Enables businesses to sell agricultural products such as tools, seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.  
  - **My contribution:** Developed backend services and built a remedy suggestion system that recommends products based on detected crop diseases using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.

The three components are tightly integrated to enhance user experience. For example, a farmer identifying a crop disease through the advisory module receives product recommendations from the e-commerce platform and can seek further guidance through the discussion forum. This synergy ensures seamless support, actionable solutions, and community engagement for the stakeholders engaged in the economic sector.
